/** The <code>LockOnce</code> class represents an object used to guard some block of code that is only to be accessed once.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking">double-checked-locking</a> idiom and allows to
 * use it just like similar classes, such as the {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This could be used for lazy singleton initialization. However, this is considered to be an antipattern by some. They argue that it is
 * better to use a nested static class as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_on_demand_holder_idiom"><i>initialization
 * on demand holder</i></a>. The argument that it is broken is only true for JVM &lt;= 1.4, but not for newer versions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The given solution in this class is safe on JVM 1.5+ thanks to the Java Memory Model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately follow a call to {@code lockOnce} with a {@code try} block, most typically in a
 * before/after construction such as:
 * 
 * <pre><tt>
 * final LockOnce lo = new LockOnce();
 * if (lo.lockOnce()) try {
 *   // ... method body
 * } finally {
 *   lo.unlock();
 * }</tt></pre>
